This document describes a quantum assembly language (QASM) variant called OpenQASM that is used to implement experiments with low depth quantum circuits on the IBM Quantum Experience (QX). OpenQASM represents universal physical circuits over the CNOT plus SU(2) basis with straight-line code that includes measurement, reset, fast feedback, and gate subroutines. The simple text language can be written by hand or by higher level tools.
