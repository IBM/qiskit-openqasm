This directory is the start of a list of examples that can run on the IBM Quantum Experience **ibmqx2** device. This device went online January 24th 2017.
The connectivity map for the CNOTS in this device are
```
coupling_map = {0: [1, 2], 1: [2], 3: [2, 4], 4: [2]}
```
Where a: [b] means a CNOT with qubit a as control and b as target can be implemented.

The connectivity is provided by two coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators with resonances around 6.0 GHz (coupling Q2, Q3 and Q4) and 6.5 GHz (coupling Q0, Q1 and Q2). Each qubit has a dedicated CPW for control and readout. The following picture shows the chip layout.

The circuits listed below, which you can find in this directory, are a few examples of experiments that can be ran in this device.

- iswap.qasm: Implements the two-qubit entangling gate iSWAP, defined by the matrix
[1 0 0 0],[0,0,i,0],[0,i,0,0],[0,0,0,1].

- W3test.qasm: Implements the three-qubit maximally entangled W state |001> + |010> + |100>.

- Deutsch_Algorithm.qasm: A two-qubit example of Deutsch to determine whether a function is constant (in which case the algorithm returns 0) or balanced (returns 1). In this example the algorithm looks at the function f(x) = x, which is balanced.

- 011\_3\_qubit\_grover_50_.qasm: This circuit demonstrate Grover's search algorithm over three qubits. In this case it searchs for the state 110 with probability of success > 50%.

- qe\_qft\_3(4)(5).qasm: Quantum Fourier transforms with 3, 4, and 5 qubits.
